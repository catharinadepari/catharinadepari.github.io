    <h2>Geotourism</h2>
    <p>Geo-tourism industry has grown rapidly in volcanic areas due to the curiosity of people to have sightseeing experiences directly in the affected places. These social phenomena are associated with natural disasters, death, and tragedy, and cause this type of tourism to fall within the scope dark tourism (Stone et al. in Migoń & Pijet-Migoń, 2019, pp. 630-631). Geo-tourism attracts not only tourists but also those from other areas to occupy the land for business operations. A recent study reported that more than 8% of the world’s 2015 population lived within 100 km of a volcano with at least one significant eruption. In Southeast Asia particularly, the highest population growth rates have occurred in close proximity to volcanoes (within 10 km) in the last 40 years (Freire, Florczyk, Pesaresi, & Sliuzas, 2019, p. 16). </p>

    <h2>Dairy Farming</h2>
    <p>Dairy farming is the main local economic activity. Despite the decreasing number of those who are still interested in continuing this tradition, many locals dominated by women, run the industry for many reasons. The local women feel attached to the cattles and would like to support their families' incomes. Due to their emotional bond to the cattles. it is not surprising if many women refused to relocate during the eruption in 2010. The cow dairy farming has supported the customers' demands over the products not only in Yogyakarta, but also in other cities in Central Java Province.</p>
