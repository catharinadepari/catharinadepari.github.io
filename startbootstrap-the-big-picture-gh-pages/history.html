    <h2>Hindus-BUddha Periode</h2>
    <p>According to a Dutch geologist, R.W.van Bammelen, there was a massive mobilization of the ancient society of Mataram Hindu from Central Java to East Java after Merapi erupted in 1006. Originated from a tectonic movement along the old Cesar fault, the eruption buried most of the Mataram’s artifacts including Borobudur and Mendut temples. Despite the debates about the exact time of the eruption, the artifacts discovered at the volcano’s valley in 2016 proved the existence of this ancient civilization around Mount Merapi.</p>
    <p>Influenced by Hindu-Buddha’s teachings from 8th to 16th A.D., the ancient community of Java perceived Merapi as a sacred place where their ancestral spirits and deities resided and the Sultan as the direct descendent of the God (Triyoga, 1991, p. 35). In terms of settlement arrangement, this community built their dwellings around the volcano’s valleys where fertile highlands existed (Ige, 2016; Triyoga, 1991, p. 35) and oriented their houses in opposite direction from the volcano which according to their belief, was aimed at preventing daemons from entering their dwellings.</p>
