    <h2>Hindus-Buddha Period</h2>
    <p>According to a Dutch geologist, R.W.van Bammelen, there was a massive mobilization of the ancient society of Mataram Hindu from Central Java to East Java after Merapi erupted in 1006. Originated from a tectonic movement along the old Cesar fault, the eruption buried most of the Mataram’s artifacts including Borobudur and Mendut temples. Despite the debates about the exact time of the eruption, the artifacts discovered at the volcano’s valley in 2016 proved the existence of this ancient civilization around Mount Merapi.</p>
    <p>Influenced by Hindu-Buddha’s teachings from 8th to 16th A.D., the ancient community of Java perceived Merapi as a sacred place where their ancestral spirits and deities resided and the Sultan as the direct descendent of the God (Triyoga, 1991, p. 35). In terms of settlement arrangement, this community built their dwellings around the volcano’s valleys where fertile highlands existed (Ige, 2016; Triyoga, 1991, p. 35) and oriented their houses in opposite direction from the volcano which according to their belief, was aimed at preventing daemons from entering their dwellings.</p>

    <h2>Islam Period</h2>
    <p>Islam became the official religion of Mataram when Sultan Agung reigned over the kingdom. Under his administration in the 16th century, Sultan Agung integrated Islam with the former Hindus values and had moved the capital city for several times from Pajang to Kotagede, Plered, and Kartasura (Triyoga, 1991). In these four regions, Sultan consistently adopted the ancient Hindus concept into the city plan (Junianto, 2017, p. 246). In this plan, the palace served as the city core while the civic market was placed by the Sultan at the northern side of the palace.</p>
    <p>The second zone of the city plan was dedicated for the settlements of the royal servants and public facilities such as open space and Mosque. The settlements of peasant, traders, and craftsmen were located at the third zone, which then encouraged an intense social interaction among them (fig.3). The integration between the ancient Hindu and Islamic values also contributed in dividind the Mataram Islam society into three groups: priyayi, the group who holds Islam as their religion, but still performs shamanism practices and thus, includes people living around Merapi; santri, the group who holds the original teachings of Islam and avoids ancestral rituals; and abangan, the group who focuses on daily life rather than religious matters (Burhani, 2017, p. 333).</p>

    <h2>Dutch Colonialism Period</h2>
    <p>Mataram Islam reached its prime condition under the reign of Sultan Agung who ruled between 1613 and 1646, but then experienced a setback due to the internal conflict among the royal members.During this period, the Dutch had already established its trading company VOC (Vereenigde Oost Indische Compagnie) in Batavia and a close relationship with the monarchy rulers in Java. The relationship between the Dutch and Mataram Islam tensed up in 1624 due to the VOC’s attempts of colonializing the Mataram’s territories. Recognizing the internal conflict in the monarchy, the Dutch employed devide et impera strategy which led to the breaking up between the conflicting royal members in 1755. Based on this treaty, the monarchy’s territory was divided into two jurisdictions: Yogyakarta, ruled by Sultan Hamengkubuwono I and Surakarta, ruled by Pakubowono III. Sultan Hamengkubuwono I then established a palace at Pacethokan village and planned the city structure based on the ancient. Hindu’s concept of macro-micro cosmos </p> Influenced by Hindu-Buddha’s teachings from 8th to 16th A.D., the ancient community of Java perceived Merapi as a sacred place where their ancestral spirits and deities resided and the Sultan as the direct descendent of the God (Triyoga, 1991, p. 35). Sultan orderly placed the palace on a direct line between Mount Merapi and Java Sea to the south, which symbolizes the relationship between macro-cosmos—the world of the ancestral spirits—and micro-cosmos—the world of mankind—with the palace as the guardian (Karsono, 1996; Setyowati, 2007).
    To safeguard the harmony between Merapi and Java Sea, the palace performs ritual offerings every year and to facilitate the rite in Mount Merapi, Sultan appointed a local’s ritual expert known as key master or locally termed as juru kunci (Dove, 2007, p. 122). In terms of settlement arrangement, this community built their dwellings around the volcano’s valleys where fertile highlands existed (Ige, 2016; Triyoga, 1991, p. 35) and oriented their houses in opposite direction from the volcano which according to their belief, was aimed at preventing daemons from entering their dwellings.</p>

    <h2>Modern Period</h2>
    <p>Yogyakarta became an integral part of the Republic of Indonesia after the nation’s declaration of independence. The integration was based on a political contract between Soekarno and Sultan Hamengkubowono IX and was signed on September 5, 1945. Sultan gave away some of Yogyakarta’s territories to the republic. In return, Soekarno designated Yogyakarta as a special district by issuing the Constitutional Law No. 3 in 1950. Based on this law, the position of governor is accorded to the Sultan and his rightful descendants to the throne for life (Kompasiana, 2010). Sultan, therefore, has two political roles in Yogyakarta: the royal leader and governor. Administratively, Mount Merapi region lies within the territories of four regions of two provinces in Java which include Sleman regency in the Province of Yogyakarta and Magelang, Boyolali, and Klaten regencies in the Province of Central Java (BAPPENAS & BNPB, 2011). The southern flank of Mount Merapi specifically is under the jurisdiction of Yogyakarta. However, the spatial planning and development of Mount Merapi always engaged the two provincial authorities, especially after the eruption in 2010 which had caused 347 dead tolls, 258 injuries, and 3,705 total damaged buildings (Kementerian Energi dan Sumber Daya, 2014). About 496 Ha of  Merapi’s lands comprising agricultural farms and cultivated fields were also severely destroyed during the event (Nugroho & Rudiarto, 2014, pp. 35-36).
