    <h2>How does it apply to Mount Merapi?</h2>
    <p>During my field-survey back in 2019, I found some interesting themes emerged from my interviews with villagers living in Palemsari Village, Umbulharjo, Cangkringan Disctrict. Despite the eruption devasting impacts in 2010, the villagers returned to their former high risk areas and others established new settlement which is located relatively nearby their former homes located about 5 kms around the volcano's crater. However, most of them routinely occupied their former lands to perform the geo-tourism business, worked either as parking keeper, tourist's guides, food vendors, or jeep drivers. The villagers perform this activity collectively and share the daily incomes for the whole households.</p>
    <p>Women who continued the dairy farming, struggle every morning to seek wildgrass in the deep forest regardless the risks they encounter while doing this.This partly shows their high dependence on the natural resources of the volcano which defines the people's attachment to their places. However, emotional based factors such as childhood memories might be more dominant than the economic or functional reasons in explaining this phenomenon. </p>

      <h6><small>We hear the eruption when we collect grass in the forest..We also see falling rocks, erupted by the volcano..On Tuesday…yes, yesterday..going further to the north, we tried to collect grass…It is 4,5 kilometers from our former kampoeng..To find them, we should reach 3 kilometer from the crater…We have to be hurry when collecting the grass..We always observe the volcano..If it releases lava, we will run and leave everything behind..If it just releases rocks, alhamdullilah, it is fine..Each farmer has his or her own friends when going to the forest. We go to upper areas at 7 a.m. every morning and reaches the areas at 8 a.m.</small></h6>
      <h6><small>I am with my wife..Sometimes we go at 6.30 a.m…We leave our motorcycle at the former kampoeng of Kinahrejo and continue our journey by walking. It takes 2 hours to collect the grass..During dry season, we must go further to the forest which is 2 kilometers away from the crater. The grass are not abundant but we still can find some..In the forest, the grass are depleted since they are competed with large trees..For that 2 kilometer of distance, I only walk”</small></h6>
