    <h2>Vulnerability</h2>
    <p>Mount Merapi is the most destructive volcano in Indonesia which had caused almost 130,000 casualties since 1800.The SVI relies on the demographic characteristics of the population whose measure is aimed at identifying the distribution of social inequalities and the highest concentration of vulnerable groups who are less able to adequately respond and recover. Besides identifying the social vulnerability level of each area, mass evacuation is also another important aspect that could not be ignored in Mount Merapi disaster mitigation planning. Evacuation is a significant life-saving action which occurs by moving the impacted community from a hazardous area to a safer place in a very limited time. In hazards, immediate response leading to evacuation is needed because being at the wrong place and at the wrong time will lead to fatalities.</p>
