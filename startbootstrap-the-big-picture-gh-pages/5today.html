    <h2>Geotourism</h2>
    <p>Geo-tourism industry has grown rapidly in volcanic areas due to the increasing interests of tourists to have sightseeing experiences directly in the affected places. These social phenomena are associated with natural disasters, death, and tragedy, and cause this type of tourism to fall within the scope dark tourism (Stone et al. in Migoń & Pijet-Migoń, 2019, pp. 630-631). Geo-tourism attracts not only tourists but also those from other areas to occupy the land for business operations. A recent study reported that more than 8% of the world’s 2015 population lived within 100 km of a volcano with at least one significant eruption. In Southeast Asia particularly, the highest population growth rates have occurred in close proximity to volcanoes (within 10 km) in the last 40 years (Freire, Florczyk, Pesaresi, & Sliuzas, 2019, p. 16). The same activity along with greater consequences is now faced by Merapi villagers.

    <h2>Dairy Farming</h2>
    <p>Dairy farming is the main local economic activity. Despite the decreasing number of those who are interested in continuing this tradition, many locals dominated by women,  still run the industry for two reasons. First, to support the household income and secondly, to maintain emotional bond to the cattles. Because of these reasons. it is not surprising if many women refused to relocate during the eruption in 2010. The cow dairy farming has supported the large part of customers' demands over dairy milk, not only in Yogyakarta, but also in other cities around this province.</p>

    <h2>Sandmining</h2>
    <p>The sandmining industry grew rapidly since the volcano erupted in 2006, especially that in 2010. Thie activity was once legalized by the regional government, but in the past one year, it has been limited due to the massive destructions it costed. However, illegal sand mining are still practiced by locals today. Majority of labors worked in this industry is youth whose age between 15 and 20 years old. Global demand over sand for infrastructure development mainly in India and China is highly associated with the increase number of sandmining in the volcano.</p>
