    <h2>Attachment</h2>
    <p>Attachment begins since a child is born and develops throughout the caregiving experience received in the first years of life. Through experiences and connections to the world, people then establish meanings which affect their future behaviors. Through meaning, people develop attachment to a place with its physical features. Place becomes more than merely location because of the meaning given by people to that place. With those understandings, place attachment can therefore, be defined as a bond between an individual or group and a place that varies in terms of spatial level, degree of specificity, and social or physical features of the place, and is manifested through affective, cognitive, and behavioral psychological processes.  Place attachment can occur at different geographical scales and evoke an array of emotions in varying degree of intensity.</p>
    <p>Place attachment has values of providing protection, sense of security, supports to pursue our goals, facilitate the self-regulation needed for goal attainment, self-continuity, as well as sense of belongingness, and enhance identity and bolster self-esteem. Because of these values, place meaning has crucial role of informing design and planning practices in order to produce a socially responsive design solutions for the community they serve. The place attachment also has role of becoming sources of learning and inspirations for planners to improve the qualities of their professional works and designs </p>.
