    <h2>Geo-tourism</h2>
    <p>The geo-tourism grew is a strategy of the villagers especially those living in Merapi's most hazardous areas to maintain their ownership over their lands in h eface of regional government's relocation policy. As today, the tourism has mobilized the villagers' economy by offering tourists to travel around the impacted sites after the eruption in 2010. There is a controversy regarding this activity as this would invite and accummulate population in hazardous areas. With this reason, the government does not license the tourism business. However, many volcanic regions had proven the success of embracing this activity while also increasing their resilience to eruptions</p>

    <h2>Sandmining</h2>
    <p>Eruptions especially that in 2010 has contributed significantly to the welfare of Merapi villagers. Not only the legal industries but also the illegal ones took the advantage from this event. As today, the activity has been limited due to the environmental damagae=s it caused to the volcano. However, some villagers still performed this sandmining by their owns. Do you know that the volcanic sand is demanded by countries which massively developed their infrastructures?Many local youths worked in sandmining industries for private companies and leave education for this regards. A high number of AIDS infected people among their age grows during this harvesting period of the volcano's natural resources</p>

    <h2>Dairy Farming</h2>
    <p>Dairy farmining is villagers' traditional economic activity which has largely contributed to  the customers' demands specifically in the province and surrounding areas. The eruption in 2010 devastatingly impacted the activity as many cattles died during the event. Today, women dominated thos who still continued the sandmining in Mount Merapi. They developed emotional bond with the cattles. This was not suprising then why many of the villagers during the 2010 eruption refused to leave their cattles behind</p>
