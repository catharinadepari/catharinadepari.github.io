    <h2>Geo-tourism</h2>
    <p>According to a Dutch geologist, R.W.van Bammelen, there was a massive mobilization of the ancient society of Mataram Hindu from Central Java to East Java after Merapi erupted in 1006. Originated from a tectonic movement along the old Cesar fault, the eruption buried most of the Mataram’s artifacts including Borobudur and Mendut temples. Despite the debates about the exact time of the eruption, the artifacts discovered at the volcano’s valley in 2016 proved the existence of this ancient civilization around Mount Merapi.</p>
    <p>Influenced by Hindu-Buddha’s teachings from 8th to 16th A.D., the ancient community of Java perceived Merapi as a sacred place where their ancestral spirits and deities resided and the Sultan as the direct descendent of the God (Triyoga, 1991, p. 35). In terms of settlement arrangement, this community built their dwellings around the volcano’s valleys where fertile highlands existed (Ige, 2016; Triyoga, 1991, p. 35) and oriented their houses in opposite direction from the volcano which according to their belief, was aimed at preventing daemons from entering their dwellings.</p>

    <h2>Sandmining</h2>
    <p>Eruptions especially that in 2010 has contributed significantly to the welfare of Merapi villagers. Not only the legal industries but also the illegal ones took the advantage from this event. As today, the activity has been limited due to the environmental damagae=s it caused to the volcano. However, some villagers still performed this sandmining by their owns. Do you know that the volcanic sand is demanded by countries which massively developed their infrastructures?Many local youths worked in sandmining industries for private companies and leave education for this regards. A high number of AIDS infected people among their age grows during this harvesting period of the volcano's natural resources</p>

    <h2>Dairy Farming</h2>
    <p>Mataram Islam reached its prime condition under the reign of Sultan Agung who ruled between 1613 and 1646, but then experienced a setback due to the internal conflict among the royal members.During this period, the Dutch had already established its trading company VOC (Vereenigde Oost Indische Compagnie) in Batavia and a close relationship with the monarchy rulers in Java. The relationship between the Dutch and Mataram Islam tensed up in 1624 due to the VOC’s attempts of colonializing the Mataram’s territories. Recognizing the internal conflict in the monarchy, the Dutch employed devide et impera strategy which led to the breaking up between the conflicting royal members in 1755. Based on this treaty, the monarchy’s territory was divided into two jurisdictions: Yogyakarta, ruled by Sultan Hamengkubuwono I and Surakarta, ruled by Pakubowono III. Sultan Hamengkubuwono I then established a palace at Pacethokan village and planned the city structure based on the ancient. Hindu’s concept of macro-micro cosmos </p> Influenced by Hindu-Buddha’s teachings from 8th to 16th A.D., the ancient community of Java perceived Merapi as a sacred place where their ancestral spirits and deities resided and the Sultan as the direct descendent of the God (Triyoga, 1991, p. 35). Sultan orderly placed the palace on a direct line between Mount Merapi and Java Sea to the south, which symbolizes the relationship between macro-cosmos—the world of the ancestral spirits—and micro-cosmos—the world of mankind—with the palace as the guardian (Karsono, 1996; Setyowati, 2007).
    To safeguard the harmony between Merapi and Java Sea, the palace performs ritual offerings every year and to facilitate the rite in Mount Merapi, Sultan appointed a local’s ritual expert known as key master or locally termed as juru kunci (Dove, 2007, p. 122). In terms of settlement arrangement, this community built their dwellings around the volcano’s valleys where fertile highlands existed (Ige, 2016; Triyoga, 1991, p. 35) and oriented their houses in opposite direction from the volcano which according to their belief, was aimed at preventing daemons from entering their dwellings.</p>
