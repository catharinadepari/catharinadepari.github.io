    <h2>Phenomenal Gate Keeper</h2>
    <p>Mbah Maridjan was the cultural symbol of ount Merapi. Despite his death during the 2010 eruption, his legacies remained. His popularity began from his refusal to leave the volcano during the 2006 eruption. The Sultan who was also the governor of the province of Yogyakarta Special Regions was perceived by the gate keeper as political leader rather than a Sultan. He was appointed by the former Sultan to lead the spiritual rite of Labuhan Merapi which ironically was
    delivered to him. Find more about controversies revolved around the figure which ever since, had inspired his community to remain in their beloved lands in this website</p>
