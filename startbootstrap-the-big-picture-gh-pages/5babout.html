    <h4>Environment</h4>
    <p>According to a Dutch geologist, R.W.van Bammelen, there was a massive mobilization of the ancient society of Mataram Hindu from Central Java to East Java after Merapi erupted in 1006 (Triyoga, 1991, p. 21). Originated from a tectonic movement along the old Cesar fault, the eruption buried most of the Mataram’s artifacts including Borobudur and Mendut temples. Despite the debates about the exact time of the eruption, the artifacts discovered at the volcano’s valley in 2016 proved the existence of this ancient civilization around Mount Merapi. Influenced by Hindu-Buddha’s teachings from 8th to 16th A.D., the ancient community of Java perceived Merapi as a sacred place where their ancestral spirits and deities resided and the Sultan as the direct descendent of the God (Triyoga, 1991, p. 35). In terms of settlement arrangement, this community built their dwellings around the volcano’s valleys where fertile highlands existed (Ige, 2016; Triyoga, 1991, p. 35). </p>

    <h4>Community</h4>
    <p>Merapi’s eruption in 2010 with rapid onset and large magnitude had displaced almost 400,000 people and posed great challenges in evacuation processes (Mei, et al., 2013, p. 2). Despite these impacts, most villagers returned to their settlements and developed various activities including geotourism business in areas situated only 5 kms from the volcano’s crater (Ginting, 2020; Sagala, et al., 2012, p. 1; Davis, 2013). There is an increasing awareness that this illegal business would promote more population concentration in high risk areas which means to put more lives in risks (Ginting, 2020)</p>

    <h4>Gate Keeper</h4>
    <p>As a royal servant appointed directly by Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX, Mbah Maridjan was obliged to prepare and lead the court’s spiritual rite Labuhan Gunung on the slopes of Merapi. The aim of this rite is to maintain the harmonious relationship between the deities living in Mount Merapi, those in the South Sea, and the Sultanate. But what made this local spiritual leader gain international acclaim was his refusal to evacuate as ordered by the Sultan HB X, the successor and the descendant of Sultan HB IX. Mbah Maridjan argued that he obeyed only to the Sultan HB IX and the order of the Sultan HB X as what came from a governor, not from a Sultan (Maarif, et al., 2012, p. 7). The gate keepeer also argued that staying in Mount Merapi enabled him to pray for the safety of all Yogyakarta citizens.</p>
