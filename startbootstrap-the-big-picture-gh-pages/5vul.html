        <p class="lead">Our project attempts to accommodate the Sleman Regional Government’s concern on updating Mount Merapi’s evacuation route that considers the recent demographic characteristics of disaster prone communities and populations distributions around the crater. The recent disaster contingency plans refer to the cataclysmic eruption in 2010. The eruption had not only caused a great loss, but also increased the risk level of people living in the south flank due to the significant deformation on Merapi’s dome after the eruption. Merapi villagers’ refusal to relocate, the population and development growths around the volcano, and the geotourism business emerged around its crater, undoubtedly exacerbate the vulnerability of not only the inhabitants around the south flank but also those in the city center of Yogyakarta. Due to this change, the hazardous zones were enlarged from 15 to 20 kms and classified into 3 zones. The third zone is designated as the most hazardous areas that are prone to pyroclastic flow, the second zone cover areas that are prone mainly to volcanic rocks and ash including pyroclastic flow with lower risks, while the fist zone covers those that are prone to volcanic lahars flowing through the riverways.

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>There are two factors that mainly contribute to the vulnerability of Merapi villagers: 1) socioeconomic factors in which the natural resources becomes the main reason why the villagers remained on Merapi’s flanks; 2) socio-cultural factors in which the traditional beliefs of deities, ancestral spirits, and key master who guard the volcano gave a sense of security to the villagers (Mei, et al., 2013, p. 2). To mitigate the future eruption impacts, it is crucial to consider the communities’ socio-economy characteristics in hazards planning (Cutter & Finch, 2008, p. 2301). The degree to which populations are vulnerable to hazards does not rely only on their proximity to hazards sources, but also on their demographic conditions (Cutter, et al., 2000, p. 714). With this insight, this study will measure the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) of Mount Merapi by identifying its high risk populations that may be less likely to respond to, cope with, and recover from disasters (Ogie & Pradhan, 2019; Cutter & Finch, 2008). The SVI relies on the demographic characteristics of the population whose measure is aimed at identifying the distribution of social inequalities and the highest concentration of vulnerable groups who are less able to adequately respond and recover (Cutter & Finch, 2008). Besides identifying the social vulnerability level of each area, mass evacuation is also an important aspect of Mount Merapi’s disaster mitigation planning. Evacuation is a significant life-saving action which occurs by moving the impacted community from a hazardous area to a safer place in a very limited time. </p>
    <p>In hazards, immediate response leading to evacuation is needed because being at the wrong place and at the wrong time will lead to fatalities (Jumadi, et al., 2018, p. 2). The goal of this study is to inform decision making and disaster mitigation planning in Sleman Regency in improving the community resilience to eruption by providing a comprehensive disaster mitigation plan that considers the community’s social economic conditions and household demography, and assessing the existing evacuation routes and centers. The research questions generated from the aforementioned problem are: 1) Which areas in Mount Merapi are socio-culturally and economically risk to future eruptions?; 2) How effective are the existing evacuation centers and routes in improving the local resilience to disaster impacts, especially in high risk areas? 3) Based on the first and second questions, what are the recommended evacuation centers and evacuation routes? </p>

    <h1>Household Status Index</h1>
    <p>The map of the SVI of Households Composition (fig.7) shows that there are 6 villages with high SVI value: Umbulmartani, Wukirsari, Margorejo, Wonokerto, Purwobinangun, and Donokerto where the Umbulmartani Village in Ngemplak District is ranked as area with the highest SVI value. The high SVI is distributed throughout our study area with concentration on the west and north sides of the region. Our village level data show that the total vulnerable population (elderly, infant, and female) in each of these villages ranges from 8,149 to 11,243 (data table is provided in appendix). In order to find the village(s) with the highest overall social vulnerability, we combined the SVI values of the two themes. The map and the graph of the overall SVI is provided at fig.8.

    <h2>Overall Social Vulnerability Index</h2>
    <p>Taken together, we found that the village with the highest SVI is Wukirsari (fig.8). Our SVI analysis on socioeconomic and household composition show that Wukirsari Village consistently has SVI value close to 1, indicating its high vulnerability respectively. The high SVI of Wukirsari is worsened by the fact that it also lies on the south flank, which is relatively prone to pyroclastic flows and volcanic rocks (the map of Mount Merapi’s hazardous zones is provided in appendix). Thus, we recommend that Wukirsari Village is prioritized in the future emergency responses by ensuring evacuation accessibility to this village and increasing its resilience in all aspects/ </p>

    <h1>Evacuation Routes and Centers</h1>
    <p>When using the existing evacuation routes as the basic “street system” in Network Analysis in ArcGIS, we found that only 23 out of 67 evacuation centers are chosen as the effective ones when setting the searching distance as 5000 m (Fig. 9a). And 9 out of 26 population points are served by the existing evacuation routes and centers. In addition, there are only 28 available lines to allow villagers to travel from streets in the village to the nearby (multiple) evacuation centers. As the population serving coverage is low (9 out of 26 village-level population points are served), we further analyzed the effectiveness of the evacuation centers based on the current street system. </p>

    <h2>Efective and Candidate Evacuation Centers </h2>
    <p> The population needed to be accommodated are further analyzed based on the weighted population assigned to each evacuation center. The population in each evacuation center range from 195 to 10190. The population needed to be accommodated for each effective evacuation center is shown in Appendix. Based on the effective evacuation centers, served population points and current street system, the recommended evacuation routes and centers are created using “New Route” and “Location Allocation” tools in Network Analysis in ArcGIS (Fig. 10a). According to Fig.10a, the existing evacuation routes only occupied part of the recommended evacuation routes and can only serve the population in 9 villages (the total is 26) due to its unconnected and missing routes. The recommended evacuation centers and routes include 65 evacuation centers and 176 evacuation lines, effectively serving the population of 24 villages in Mount Merapi, except for two villages in the southwest. According to the current street system, the current efficiency of evacuation centers is 65/67 * 100% = 97%, as 65 out of 67 evacuation centers are selected as effective ones. In the southwest of the Mount Merapi region, 2 evacuation centers were not chosen as effective ones because of the poor street connectivity in these areas. In addition, in the northeast of the region, evacuation centers are chosen as effective ones through Network Analysis in ArcGIS, but in fact, these places do not have a road connecting the population points to the evacuation centers. Therefore, conceptual streets are recommended in both the southwest and northeast of the Mount Merapi region, to allow people in both these places to be accommodated in the nearby evacuation centers.

    <h1>Recommended Evacuation Plan</h1>
    <p>WTaken together the recommended evacuation routes, centers, conceptual street system, and the SVI evaluation results, we found that the village with the highest SVI value – Wukirsari Village, has a well-established evacuation route system and 3 effective evacuation centers (now accommodating 1,4760 population). Therefore, in the event of a disaster, the recommended evacuation routes and centers would provide a good service to the villagers of Wukirsari.In addition, the villages that require street connectivity between and to their evacuation centers relatively have low Social Vulnerability Index (fig. 11). Despite this fact, we recommend the Sleman regional authority to immediately develop: the streets connecting the evacuation centers in Banyurejo and Sumberrejo Villages in the southwest of Mount Merapi region, and 2. the streets connecting the population of Kepuharjo and Glagaharjo Villages in the northeast of Mount Merapi region to the nearby evacuation centers. </p>
